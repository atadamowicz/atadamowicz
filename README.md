## Why testing?

I always loved exploring and finding loopholes in applications, websites, video games, board games. My knack for understanding rules and spotting flaws led me naturally into testing.

## Experience

I've been a video game tester for over 3.5 years, and I have also been learning web development and web application testing for over a year now.
